# Chessify

Machine learning to predict chess outcomes.

Through analyzing over 1 000 000 online chess games, Chessify predicts the expected value of a matchup given the players' ratings. The score system follows standard chess rules with 1 point for a win, 0 for a loss, and 1/2 for a draw.

Test data originates from Lichess.org, but is parsed and organized by me.
